# PYTHON DESERILAZATION
Certainly! Serialization is the process of converting a Python object into a format that can be stored or transmitted. Deserialization is the reverse process of converting the serialized data back into a Python object.

Serialization in Python refers to the process of converting a Python object into a format that can be easily stored or transmitted. This format is typically a string or a byte stream. Deserialization, on the other hand, is the process of converting the serialized data back into a Python object.

Serialization allows you to save the state of an object and recreate it later or send it over a network. It is useful for tasks like saving data to a file, transferring data between different systems, or storing data in a database.

Python provides built-in modules like pickle, json, and yaml to perform serialization and deserialization. These modules handle the conversion process automatically, allowing you to easily save and restore the state of objects.

By using serialization, you can persist data, transfer it across different platforms or systems, and reconstruct it as needed, making it a valuable tool in various applications.

Shortly the system will convert the input from object become the format that can be transmitted. Hence the system will execute it. 

So the purpose of this attack is to execute os command such as id, whoami and etc using python deserialization.

1. Open page
2. Insert input using yaml format

3. The system convert yaml format into json
